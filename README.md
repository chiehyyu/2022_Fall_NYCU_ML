## HW2 Linear Discriminant Analysis, due date: Nov. 1, 23:59

### Goals
In hw2, you need to implement [Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis) by using only numpy, then train your implemented model by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data

Please note that only **NUMPY** can be used to implement your model, you will get no points by simply calling sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis

## HW3 Decision Tree, AdaBoost and Random Forest, due date: Nov. 15, 23:59

### Goals

In this coding assignment, you need to implement the Decision Tree, AdaBoost and Random Forest algorithm by using only NumPy, then train your implemented model by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data. Find the sample code and data on the GitHub page.

Please note that only NumPy can be used to implement your model, you will get no points by simply calling sklearn.tree.DecsionTreeClassifier.

## HW4 Support Vector Machine, due date: Nov. 29, 23:59

### Goals

In this coding assignment, you need to implement the Cross-validation and grid search by using only NumPy, then train the SVM model from scikit-learn by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data. 

Please note that only NumPy can be used to implement cross-validation and grid search, you will get no points by simply calling [sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV)
